This time it's super quick.

## Dependencies
- https://github.com/vincentlaucsb/csv-parser?ref=bestofcpp.com#integration
- Google benchmark
- boost

## Notes to myself
- make install steps (install deps, cmake ., make, sh files adjustments)
- req file for python (matplotlib, pandas)

- A docker image could be fun.
